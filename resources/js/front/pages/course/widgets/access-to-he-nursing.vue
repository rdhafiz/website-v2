                        <br><br>
                        Success comes from being able to establish trusting relationships quickly and to help
                        individuals understand their situation and get the best possible outcome. You'll be trained

                    <div class="course-details-description">
                        Children have very specific health needs and you need to understand how a healthy child develops
                        towards adulthood to minimize the impact of illness. This involves working in closely with the
                        parents or guardians.
                        <br><br>
                        Communication is also a factor when treating children. Adults can express their feelings and can
                        identify the severity and nature of pain. A child may not be able to communicate this in such
                        detail, and the nurse needs to interpret the child’s behavior and reactions. Children's nurses
                        need to be able to spot when a child's health takes a turn for the worse, which can often happen
                        rapidly.
                        <br><br>
                        A child’s care takes place in a range of settings, including, hospitals, daycare centres,
                        clinics and in the community, such as a child's home
                        <br><br>

                    <div class="course-details-description">
                        Children identified as having a learning disability are living longer, more fulfilled lives into
                        adolescence, adulthood and older age. Learning disability nurses play a vital role working
                        across the whole life span in both health and care settings.
                        <br><br>
                        The main areas of your role as a learning disability nurse involve:

                        <ul>
                            <li>

                            <li>

                        Learning disability nurses may also help people to learn the skills needed to find work. This
                        can be significant in helping them to lead a more independent and healthy life where they can
                        relate to others on equal terms.
