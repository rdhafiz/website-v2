                                    also with their relatives and careers. You might help one person to take their

                                    Success comes from being able to establish trusting relationships quickly and to
                                    help
                                    individuals understand their situation and get the best possible outcome. You'll be
                                    trained
                                    about the legal context of your work and also be able to identify whether and when

                                    be at risk of harming themselves or someone else.

                                    work in a residential setting, you may do shifts and provide 24-hour care.

                                    Children have very specific health needs and you need to understand how a healthy
                                    child develops
                                    towards adulthood to minimize the impact of illness. This involves working in
                                    closely with the
                                    parents or guardians.

                                    Communication is also a factor when treating children. Adults can express their
                                    feelings and can
                                    identify the severity and nature of pain. A child may not be able to communicate
                                    this in such
                                    detail, and the nurse needs to interpret the child’s behavior and reactions.

                                    need to be able to spot when a child's health takes a turn for the worse, which can
                                    often happen
                                    rapidly.

                                    A child’s care takes place in a range of settings, including, hospitals, daycare

                                    Children's nurses are part of multidisciplinary teams that look after patients. You
