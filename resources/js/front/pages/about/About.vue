                                Learners are taught in respectful and calm environments. Learners, many of whom are parents of young children, value the opportunity that trainers provide to study at times that fit around their family and work placement commitments. For example, trainers offer learners choices of lessons in evenings or at weekends. This allows learners to balance their work and family lives with their education. As a result, most learners have high attendance and stay on their course to complete their studies.

                                Learners participate in a good range of additional courses and gain extra useful qualifications. These courses help learners to develop knowledge and skills beyond the core curriculum, and prepare them for their next steps such as work placement, employment or further study. For example, most early years learners gain safeguarding qualifications that employers value.
