                                Work placement is an integral part of the course and without it you will be unable to
                                complete the course. You will draw on workplace experience during taught sessions and
                                apply what you have learned during classes in your work practice. Assignments draw on
                                your work experience and assessment includes observation in the workplace. If you are
                                struggling with finding a work placement our team may be able to help you.
